3. Extensibility. In a parallel system, accommodating increasing database sizes or increasing performance demands (e.g., throughput) should be easier. Extensibility is the ability to expand the system smoothly by adding processing and storage power to the system. Ideally, the parallel database system should demonstrate two extensibility advantages [DeWitt and Gray, 1992]: linear speedup and linear scaleup see Figure 14.1. Linear speedup refers to a linear increase in performance for a constant database size while the number of nodes (i.e., processing and storage power) are increased linearly. Linear scaleup refers to a sustained performance for a linear increase in both database size and number of nodes. Furthermore, extending the system should require minimal reorganization of the existing database.
